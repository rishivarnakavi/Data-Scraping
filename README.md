# CBSE Schools Data

[CBSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Board_of_Secondary_Education) is one of the two national level boards of education in India (alongwith [CISCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Board_of_Secondary_Education)).
While CISCE is a private board, CBSE is public, central government run board.
Every year, over **1 million** students take the CBSE Class XII (12) board examination as a high school leaving examination in India (and several schools abroad).

>**The sister repository to this, contains the [cisce_schools_data](https://github.com/deedy/cisce_schools_data).**


As of **2018**, there are **20,367** schools affiliated with the CBSE (out of which only 220 are outside India).
The details of each of these schools can be fetched from the [CBSE School Directory](http://cbseaff.nic.in/cbse_aff/schdir_Report/userview.aspx).
